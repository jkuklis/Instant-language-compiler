Program compilation:
    make

Translate input into .j and .class files:
    insc_jvm path/to/file

Translate input into .ll and .bc files:
    insc_llvm path/to/file


Output files are created in the same directory as the input file.

Makefile:
- instantM: 
    bnfc is used to make sources for parser, lexer and necessary data structures from the grammar file, Instant.cf. Files are created in 'instant' directory. I didn't manage to use option -o on students with bnfc, thus I copy the source file and cd this directory to use bnfc.

- compiler:
    Use default ghc to compile the proper Compiler executable. Files are created in 'build' directory.

- rights:
    Add executable rights to bash scripts insc_jvm and insc_llvm.

- clean:
    Remove created files.


java -jar jasmin.jar is used to generate a .class file from a .j file, jasmin.jar is kept in 'jasmin' directory.

llvm-as is used to create a .bc file from a .ll file, which is later linked with runtime.bc. located in 'llvm_runtime' directory.


It was not specified in the task description what shall be done when an undeclared variable usage is encountered in the input program. In my solution I check whether all the evaluated variables have already been declared, in case it's not the case my program prints errors and does not output VM files.
